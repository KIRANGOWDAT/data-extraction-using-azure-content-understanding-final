# Exercise 3: Configuring the Application

### Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will configure the document extraction application to connect to the Azure services deployed in Exercise 2. This involves setting up local Azure Functions settings, updating the application configuration YAML with your specific resource endpoints and Key Vault secret references, installing Python dependencies, and starting the Function App locally. By the end of this exercise, all five backend services will be healthy and the API endpoints ready for use.

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Configure local settings for Azure Functions
- Task 2: Update app_config.yaml with Azure service endpoints
- Task 3: Retrieve secrets and endpoints from deployed resources
- Task 4: Set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies
- Task 5: Start the Azure Function App locally
- Task 6: Verify the health check endpoint

### Task 1: Configure local settings for Azure Functions

In this task, you will create the local Azure Functions settings file that defines runtime environment variables.

1. In VS Code, open the integrated terminal (**Ctrl+`**) and navigate to the **src** directory:

   ```
   cd C:\LabFiles\data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding\src
   ```

1. Copy the sample settings file to create your local configuration:

   ```
   copy local.settings.sample.json local.settings.json
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image02.png)

1. Open **local.settings.json** **(1)** in the VS Code Explorer. Review the contents:

   ```json
   {
     "IsEncrypted": false,
     "Values": {
       "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
       "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
       "PYTHON_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING": "1",
       "ENVIRONMENT": "local",
       "FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION": "~4",
       "WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION": "~18"
     }
   }
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image03.png)

1. Notice the key settings:

   - **FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME** — Set to `python` for the Python Azure Functions runtime.
   - **AzureWebJobsStorage** — Set to `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` for local development (uses the Azurite storage emulator).
   - **ENVIRONMENT** — Set to `local` which tells the application to load the `local:` section from `app_config.yaml`.
   - **FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION** — Uses Azure Functions v4 runtime.

1. Navigate to the **Azure Portal**, open your **Storage Account** **(1)** (`devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wusa0`), go to **Access keys** **(2)**, and copy the **Connection string** **(3)**.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image04.png)

1. Replace the `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` value in **local.settings.json** with the copied connection string:

   ```json
   {
     "IsEncrypted": false,
     "Values": {
       "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
       "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<your-storage-connection-string>",
       "PYTHON_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING": "1",
       "ENVIRONMENT": "local",
       "FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION": "~4",
       "WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION": "~18"
     }
   }
   ```

1. **Save** the file (**Ctrl+S**).

   >**Note:** The `local.settings.json` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` as it contains sensitive connection strings. Never commit this file to a repository.

### Task 2: Update app_config.yaml with Azure service endpoints

In this task, you will update the application configuration file with the actual endpoints and Key Vault secret references for your deployed Azure resources.

1. In VS Code Explorer, navigate to **src** > **resources** **(1)** and click on **app_config.yaml** **(2)** to open it.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image05.png)

1. The file has a `local:` section at the top that corresponds to the `ENVIRONMENT=local` setting. It contains configuration for:

   - **key_vault_uri** — Azure Key Vault endpoint (for resolving secrets)
   - **cosmosdb** — Database name, connection string (from Key Vault), collection names
   - **llm** — Azure OpenAI model name, endpoint, API key (from Key Vault)
   - **content_understanding** — CU endpoint, subscription key (from Key Vault), timeout, project ID
   - **chat_history** — Cosmos DB SQL API endpoint, database and container names
   - **blob_storage** — Storage account URL and container name

1. Start with the **Key Vault URI**. In the Azure Portal, open your Key Vault **(1)** (`devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wuKv0`), go to **Overview** **(2)**, and copy the **Vault URI** **(3)**.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image06.png)

1. Update the `key_vault_uri` value in the `local:` section:

   ```yaml
   local:
     key_vault_uri: "https://devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wuKv0.vault.azure.net/"
   ```

1. Retrieve the **tenant_id** by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   az account show --query tenantId -o tsv
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image07.png)

1. Update the `tenant_id` value in the `local:` section with the copied tenant ID.

### Task 3: Retrieve secrets and endpoints from deployed resources

In this task, you will gather all remaining endpoints and configuration values from your deployed Azure resources to complete the app_config.yaml file.

1. Get the **Azure OpenAI endpoint**. In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource **(1)** (`devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wuaoai0`), go to **Keys and Endpoint** **(2)**, and copy the **Endpoint** URL **(3)**.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image08.png)

1. Update the `llm` section in **app_config.yaml**:

   ```yaml
   llm:
     model_name:
       value: "gpt-4o"
     endpoint:
       value: "https://devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wuaoai0.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o"
     access_key:
       key: "open-ai-key"
       type: "secret"
     api_version:
       value: "2025-04-01-preview"
   ```

   >**Note:** The `access_key` field uses `type: "secret"` which means the application resolves the value from Azure Key Vault using the key name `open-ai-key`. The Terraform deployment automatically stored this secret in Key Vault.

1. Get the **Content Understanding endpoint**. In the Azure Portal, navigate to your AI Services resource **(1)** (`devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wuais0`), go to **Keys and Endpoint** **(2)**, and copy the **Endpoint** **(3)**.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image09.png)

1. Get the **AI Foundry Project ID**. Navigate to the **AI Foundry project** **(1)** in the Azure Portal. The project ID can be found in the project overview or properties.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image10.png)

1. Update the `content_understanding` section:

   ```yaml
   content_understanding:
     endpoint:
       value: "https://devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wuais0.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
     subscription_key:
       key: "ai-foundry-key"
       type: "secret"
     request_timeout:
       value: 30
     project_id:
       value: "<your-ai-project-id>"
   ```

1. Get the **Cosmos DB SQL API endpoint** for chat history. Navigate to your Cosmos DB SQL API account **(1)** (`devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wucosmoskb0`) and copy the **URI** **(2)** from the overview page.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image11.png)

1. Update the `chat_history` section:

   ```yaml
   chat_history:
     endpoint:
       value: "https://devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wucosmoskb0.documents.azure.com:443/"
     db_name:
       value: "knowledge-base-db"
     chat_history_container_name:
       value: "chat-history"
     user_message_limit:
       value: 20
     domain:
       value: "Data Extraction AI"
   ```

1. Get the **Storage Account URL**. Navigate to your Storage Account **(1)** (`devdataext<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />wusa0`) and copy the **Blob service endpoint** **(2)** from the overview page.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image12.png)

1. Update the `blob_storage` section with the Blob service endpoint you just copied:

   ```yaml
   blob_storage:
     account_url:
       value: "https://<your-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/"
     container_name:
       value: "processed"
   ```

1. **Save** the file (**Ctrl+S**). Your `local:` section should now have all real values for Key Vault URI, tenant ID, OpenAI endpoint, Content Understanding endpoint, Cosmos DB endpoints, and Storage Account URL.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image13.png)

   >**Note:** Secret values (Cosmos DB connection string, OpenAI API key, AI Services subscription key) are NOT stored directly in this file. They are referenced by Key Vault secret names (e.g., `key: "cosmosdb-connection-string"`, `type: "secret"`). The application resolves them at runtime using the Key Vault URI. This is a security best practice.

### Task 4: Set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies

In this task, you will create a Python virtual environment and install all required packages.

1. In the terminal, navigate to the **project root** directory:

   ```
   cd C:\LabFiles\data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding
   ```

1. Create a Python virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image14.png)

1. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   You should see `(.venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image15.png)

1. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This installs all required packages including:

   | Package | Purpose |
   |---|---|
   | `azure-functions` | Azure Functions SDK |
   | `azure-keyvault-secrets` | Key Vault secret client |
   | `azure-storage-blob` | Blob storage client |
   | `azure-identity` | Azure authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) |
   | `semantic-kernel` | Microsoft Semantic Kernel for LLM orchestration |
   | `pymongo` | MongoDB driver for Cosmos DB (Mongo API) |
   | `pyyaml` | YAML configuration parser |
   | `requests` | HTTP client for Content Understanding API |
   | `cachetools` | TTL caching for health checks and collection data |

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image16.png)

1. Wait for the installation to complete. You should see **"Successfully installed"** followed by a list of all installed packages.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image17.png)

1. Verify VS Code is configured to use the virtual environment. Open **.vscode/settings.json** **(1)** and confirm the following setting exists:

   ```json
   {
     "azureFunctions.pythonVenv": ".venv"
   }
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image18.png)

### Task 5: Start the Azure Function App locally

In this task, you will start the Azure Functions application locally and verify it runs without errors.

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(.venv)` in the terminal prompt).

1. Start the Azure Function App using Azure Functions Core Tools:

   ```
   func start --script-root ./src/
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image19.png)

1. Wait for the Function App to initialize. You should see output showing that the following HTTP trigger functions have been registered:

   ```
   Functions:

       health_check:      [GET] http://localhost:7071/api/v1/health
       startup_check:     [GET] http://localhost:7071/api/v1/startup
       put_config:        [PUT] http://localhost:7071/api/configs/{name}/versions/{version}
       get_config:        [GET] http://localhost:7071/api/configs/{name}/versions/{version}
       get_default_config:[GET] http://localhost:7071/api/configs/default
       query:             [POST] http://localhost:7071/api/v1/query
       ingest_documents:  [POST] http://localhost:7071/api/ingest-documents/{collection_id}/{lease_id}/{document_name}
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image20.png)

   >**Note:** If you see errors related to Key Vault authentication, ensure you are logged in to Azure CLI (`az login`) in the same terminal session. The application uses `DefaultAzureCredential` which falls back to Azure CLI credentials for local development.

1. Keep the terminal running — the Function App must remain active for the next task.

### Task 6: Verify the health check endpoint

In this task, you will test the health check endpoint to verify that the application can connect to all backend services.

1. Open a **new terminal tab** (**Ctrl+Shift+`**) in VS Code while keeping the Function App running in the first tab.

1. Test the **startup liveness probe**:

   ```
   curl.exe http://localhost:7071/api/v1/startup
   ```

   You should receive a simple **200 OK** response confirming the Function App is running.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image21.png)

1. Test the **full health check** that verifies connectivity to all backend services:

   ```
   curl.exe http://localhost:7071/api/v1/health
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image22.png)

1. Review the health check response. When all services are healthy, you will see:

   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "checks": {
       "mongo_db":               { "status": "healthy" },
       "cosmos_db":              { "status": "healthy" },
       "key_vault":              { "status": "healthy" },
       "content_understanding":  { "status": "healthy" },
       "azure_openai":           { "status": "healthy" }
     }
   }
   ```

1. Verify that all five services show **"status": "healthy"**:

   | Service | Backend |
   |---|---|
   | **mongo_db** | Cosmos DB (Mongo API) connectivity |
   | **cosmos_db** | Cosmos DB (SQL API) for chat history |
   | **key_vault** | Azure Key Vault secret resolution |
   | **content_understanding** | Azure Content Understanding API |
   | **azure_openai** | Azure OpenAI gpt-4o model |

   >**Note:** If any service shows "unhealthy", double-check the corresponding endpoint and secret name in `app_config.yaml`. Health check results are cached for 300 seconds (5 minutes), so wait after making configuration changes before re-testing.

1. Alternatively, you can use the pre-installed **REST Client** extension to test APIs directly from VS Code. Open the file **src/samples/health_check_sample.http** **(1)**. You will see a clickable **Send Request** link above each `###` separator. Click **Send Request** **(2)** on the **local health check** line (line 13).

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDAT/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-03/image23.png)

1. The REST Client displays the response inline in VS Code, which is convenient for testing APIs throughout the remaining exercises.
