# Exercise 2: Deploying Azure Infrastructure with Terraform

### Estimated Duration: 75 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will deploy the complete Azure infrastructure required by the document extraction solution using Terraform. The solution uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure reproducible, consistent deployments. You will authenticate with Azure CLI, configure Terraform variables, deploy approximately 30–40 resources in a single run, and verify everything in the Azure Portal — including AI Foundry, Content Understanding, Cosmos DB, and Key Vault.

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Authenticate with Azure CLI
- Task 2: Configure Terraform variables
- Task 3: Deploy the Azure infrastructure
- Task 4: Verify deployed resources in the Azure Portal
- Task 5: Explore Azure AI Foundry and Content Understanding
- Task 6: Explore Azure Cosmos DB resources

### Task 1: Authenticate with Azure CLI

In this task, you will sign in to Azure CLI and select the correct subscription for deployment.

1. On the lab VM, open **Windows Terminal** **(1)** from the taskbar or desktop.

1. Run the following command to sign in to Azure:

   ```
   az login
   ```

   A browser window will open. Sign in with your Azure credentials.

   >**Note:** If you encounter a multi-factor authentication (MFA) error, use `az login --tenant <your-tenant-id>` instead. You can find the tenant ID from the error message.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image03.png)

1. After successful authentication, you will see a list of subscriptions. Select the subscription you want to use for this lab when prompted.

   If you are not prompted, list all available subscriptions:

   ```
   az account list --output table
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image04.png)

1. Set the correct subscription for this lab (replace `<your-subscription-id>` with the actual Subscription ID from the table above):

   ```
   az account set --subscription "<your-subscription-id>"
   ```

1. Verify the selected subscription:

   ```
   az account show --output table
   ```

   Confirm that the **SubscriptionId** and **Name** match your lab subscription.

### Task 2: Configure Terraform variables

In this task, you will configure the Terraform variables that control resource naming, location, and environment settings.

1. In the terminal, navigate to the **iac** directory:

   ```
   cd C:\LabFiles\data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding\iac
   ```

1. Copy the sample variables file to create your own:

   ```
   copy terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image06.png)

1. Open **terraform.tfvars** in VS Code:

   ```
   code terraform.tfvars
   ```

1. The file will open in VS Code. Replace the placeholder values with the following:

   >**Important:** Edit this file **inside VS Code**, not in the terminal. Do not copy-paste these lines into PowerShell.

   ```hcl
   # Azure subscription ID where resources will be deployed
   subscription_id = "<your-subscription-id>"

   # Azure region for resource deployment
   resource_group_location = "westus"

   # Region abbreviation used in resource naming (keep it short, 2-3 chars)
   resource_group_location_abbr = "wu"

   # Environment name (dev, test, prod, etc.)
   environment_name = "dev"

   # Use case name for resource naming
   usecase_name = "dataext"
   ```

   Replace `<your-subscription-id>` with your actual Azure Subscription ID (the one you selected in Task 1, Step 4). You can get it by running `az account show --query id -o tsv` in the terminal.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image07.png)

1. **Save** the file (**Ctrl+S**) and close the editor tab.

   >**Note:** The resource naming convention follows the pattern `{environment}{usecase}{location_abbr}` — for example, `devdataextwu`. All resources will include this prefix followed by a suffix indicating the resource type (e.g., `devdataextwuKv0` for Key Vault, `devdataextwucosmos0` for Cosmos DB).

1. Review the **variables.tf** **(1)** file to understand all available configuration options. Notice the key variables:

   - **resource_group_location** — Azure region (must be a Content Understanding preview region: `westus`, `swedencentral`, or `australiaeast`).
   - **environment_name** — Environment identifier (dev, test, prod).
   - **usecase_name** — Short name for resource naming.
   - **cognitive_deployments** — Defines the Azure OpenAI model deployment (defaults to `gpt-4o`).

### Task 3: Deploy the Azure infrastructure

In this task, you will initialize Terraform, review the deployment plan, and apply it to create all Azure resources.

1. Initialize Terraform to download provider plugins and modules:

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

   Wait for the initialization to complete. You should see the message **"Terraform has been successfully initialized!"**

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image09.png)

1. Generate the execution plan to preview what resources will be created:

   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

   Review the output. You should see approximately **30–40 resources** planned for creation, including:

   | Resource | Count |
   |---|---|
   | Resource Group | 1 |
   | Key Vault | 1 |
   | Log Analytics Workspace | 1 |
   | Cosmos DB accounts (Mongo API + SQL API) | 2 |
   | Azure OpenAI deployment (gpt-4o) | 1 |
   | AI Services (Content Understanding) | 1 |
   | Function App with App Service Plan | 1 |
   | Storage Account | 1 |
   | Application Insights | 1 |
   | RBAC role assignments | Multiple |

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image10.png)

1. Apply the Terraform plan to deploy all resources:

   ```
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image11.png)

   >**Note:** The deployment typically takes **15–25 minutes** to complete. The AI Hub and Cosmos DB resources take the longest to provision. Do not close the terminal during deployment.

1. Wait for the deployment to complete. When finished, you will see **"Apply complete!"** with the count of resources added.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image12.png)

1. Take note of any output values displayed at the end — these may include resource names and endpoints needed in later exercises.

### Task 4: Verify deployed resources in the Azure Portal

In this task, you will navigate to the Azure Portal and verify that all resources were created successfully.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to **https://portal.azure.com**. Sign in with your lab credentials if not already authenticated.

   >**Note:** Use the same Azure credentials you used to log in with `az login` in Task 1.

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **Resource groups** **(1)** in the top search bar and select **Resource groups** **(2)**.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image13.png)

1. Find and click on the resource group named **devdataextwuRg0** **(1)** (or the name matching your Terraform prefix).

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image14.png)

1. Review the list of resources in the resource group. Verify that you see the following:

   | Resource Type | Expected Name Pattern |
   |---|---|
   | Key Vault | `devdataextwuKv0` |
   | Log Analytics Workspace | `devdataextwuLog0` |
   | Azure Cosmos DB account (Mongo) | `devdataextwucosmos0` |
   | Azure Cosmos DB account (SQL) | `devdataextwucosmoskb0` |
   | Azure OpenAI | `devdataextwuaoai0` |
   | AI services | `devdataextwuais0` |
   | Function App | `devdataextwufunc<inject_random_string>` |
   | Storage Account | `devdataextwuSa<inject_random_string>` |
   | Application Insights | `devdataextwuAppi` |

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image15.png)

1. The Terraform deployment creates the Key Vault but does **not** automatically populate secrets. You need to create them manually. In the terminal, run the following commands to retrieve service keys and store them in Key Vault:

   ```powershell
   # Store Cosmos DB MongoDB connection string
   $cosmosConn = az cosmosdb keys list --name devdataextwucosmos0 --resource-group <your-resource-group> --type connection-strings --query "connectionStrings[0].connectionString" -o tsv
   Set-Content -Path "$env:TEMP\cosmosconn.txt" -Value $cosmosConn -NoNewline
   az keyvault secret set --vault-name devdataextwuKv0 --name "cosmosdb-connection-string" --file "$env:TEMP\cosmosconn.txt"

   # Store Azure OpenAI API key
   $openaiKey = az cognitiveservices account keys list --name aoaidevdataextwu --resource-group <your-resource-group> --query "key1" -o tsv
   az keyvault secret set --vault-name devdataextwuKv0 --name "open-ai-key" --value $openaiKey

   # Store AI Services subscription key
   $aiKey = az cognitiveservices account keys list --name devdataextwuais0 --resource-group <your-resource-group> --query "key1" -o tsv
   az keyvault secret set --vault-name devdataextwuKv0 --name "ai-foundry-key" --value $aiKey
   ```

   >**Note:** Replace `<your-resource-group>` with your actual resource group name. The Cosmos DB connection string is saved to a temp file first because it contains `&` characters that PowerShell would misinterpret.

1. Verify the secrets were created. Click on the **Key Vault** resource (`devdataextwuKv0`) in the Azure Portal. Navigate to **Secrets** **(1)** in the left menu. You should see three secrets:

   - `cosmosdb-connection-string`
   - `open-ai-key`
   - `ai-foundry-key`

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image16.png)

### Task 5: Explore Azure AI Foundry and Content Understanding

In this task, you will navigate to Azure AI Foundry to understand how Azure Content Understanding and Azure OpenAI are configured.

1. In the Azure Portal, go back to your resource group and click on the **Azure AI Foundry** resource (`devdataextwuais0`).

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image17.png)

1. In the left menu, expand **Resource Management** **(1)** and click on **Keys and Endpoint** **(2)**. Note the **KEY 1**, **Location/Region** (`westus`), and the **API endpoint** URL. This endpoint and key will be used by the application to communicate with Azure Content Understanding.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image18.png)

1. Go back to the resource group and click on the **Azure Open AI** resource for OpenAI (`aoaidevdataextwu`) and click on **Go to foundry portal**.

1. Navigate to **deployments** **(1)** and verify that the **gpt-4o** model has been deployed with the following settings:

   - **Model:** `gpt-4o`
   - **Version:** `2024-08-06`
   - **Deployment type:** Standard

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image19.png)

1. Click on the **gpt-4o** , Note the **Endpoint** and **Keys** for the Azure OpenAI resource — you will need these in the next exercise to configure the application.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image20.png)

### Task 6: Explore Azure Cosmos DB resources

In this task, you will explore the two Cosmos DB accounts and understand their different roles in the solution.

1. In your resource group, click on the **Cosmos DB account** **(1)** with the Mongo API (`devdataextwucosmos0`).

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image21.png)

1. In the left menu, navigate to **Data Explorer** **(1)**. This Cosmos DB (Mongo API) instance will store:

   - **Configurations** collection — Extraction configuration schemas
   - **Documents** collection — Extracted document data with fields, bounding boxes, and confidence scores

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image22.png)

   >**Note:** The database and collections will be created automatically when the application first runs.

1. Go back to the resource group and click on the **Cosmos DB account** **(1)** with the SQL API (`devdataextwucosmoskb0`).

1. Open **Data Explorer** **(1)**. Notice the **knowledge-base-db** database with the **chat-history** container. This stores conversational query history per user session.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image23.png)

1. Expand the **knowledge-base-db** database and click on the **chat-history** **(1)** container to reveal its sub-items: **Items**, **Scale & Settings**, **Stored Procedures**, **User Defined Functions**, and **Triggers**. This container stores conversational query history with a partition key of `/id` for efficient lookups by session and user.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIRANGOWDA/data-extraction-using-azure-content-understanding-final/main/media/Lab-02/image24.png)

   >**Note:** The Terraform deployment automatically configures role-based access control (RBAC) for multiple services:
   > - **Cosmos DB SQL API**: Assigns `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor` to both the Function App managed identity and your deploying user.
   > - **Storage Account**: Assigns `Storage Blob Data Contributor` to both the Function App managed identity and your deploying user, enabling blob read/write access for document ingestion.
   > - **AI Services**: Assigns `Cognitive Services User` to both the Function App managed identity and your deploying user.
